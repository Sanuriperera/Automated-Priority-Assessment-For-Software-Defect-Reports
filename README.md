# Automated-Priority-Assessment-For-Software-Defect-Reports
Abstract
Software projects, whether open or closed, often include defects. These defects can degrade the
quality and performance of the software systems. In practice, it is hard to design software that
is defect-free. Many projects will inevitably be delivered with defects because bugs are
ubiquitous in software. Developers allowed users to report defects via the bug tracking
system(BTS) so that improvements can be made to the next release of the system. Thousands of
issues are submitted every day in the (BTS). Quality engineers in the industry assign priority to
the defect report manually. Therefore, this task takes substantial time to do, and there is also a
high possibility of constructing a mistake. To overcome this issue, it is critical to developing a
method for automatically predicting the priority of a bug report.
This research project presents an innovative supervised deep learning and natural language
processing-based technique for assigning priority to software defect reports, which is currently
a manual process in most industrial companies. This proposed system divides the importance of
defect reports into five levels: P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5. It will be an excellent companion for
quality engineers, making their lives easier.
